			The internet was once the new frontier. Is there still the opportunity for new businesses to have success or has this platform been dominated by companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook?

		</p>



		<p>

			5G network is going to bring opportunities for new businesses. According to the company, Huawei, who owns the right to use the 5G network, the 5G network is several times faster than the internet that we have now, and it is going to change our lives very soon. For instance, the driverless car will require 5G because the driverless car needs to have fast and stable internet in order to give cars the human-like reflexes that might prevent the Uber accident.

		</p>



		<p>

			5G network+ artificial intelligence is going to bring Enterprise automation. That means in the future, there would not be so many people in a factory, instead, people would utilize 5G network+ artificial to make the machines, which has AI, execute multitasks in a company. Another advantage of 5G network+ artificial is that AI can control the whole a building’s AC system, so people can save more energy.        

		</p>



		<p>

			Another field is going to be changed is Game. Traditionally, if people want to play a video game, they have to have a game console because CPU and GPU in the console have the ability to perform this game. Recently, there is new stuff coming out, called, Cloud Gaming which is that the gaming graphic is going to be transmitted from a server to your personal devices, such as your computer, smartphone or tablet. This means the server has the most powerful device for running the games, and then the graphic of games will be transmitted by data. The advantage of the technology is that people don’t need to buy a gaming console anymore, and people can play the high-resolution games on your computer, smartphone or tablet. Transmitting these games which have high-quality graphics requires a very fast internet, thus, 5G internet would make this technology become true.
